    <h1>Who is Batman?</h1>
      
    <p style = "text-align:center;padding:60px;">A literal embodiment of the fear that scarred him as a child. Bruce Wayne, was unfortunate enough to witness his parents' gruesome murder. The events of that night placed him under the care of his trustworthy butler, Alfred Pennyworth. However, Wayne had an insatiable thirst for revenge. Vigilantism would soon be his answer, but yet he couldn't strike fear into the hearts of criminals. As he sat and pondered how he would accomplish such a task, a bat broke through his glass window, striking him with FEAR. His answer had come sooner than expected. He would become BATMAN.</p>
